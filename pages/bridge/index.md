# Bridge 🌉

The XRPL EVM Sidechain operates as a **standalone Layer 1 blockchain** with native XRP as the gas token. For applications that require cross-chain functionality, several bridge options are available to connect with other blockchain networks.

Bridges are specialized protocols designed to facilitate interoperability between distinct blockchain networks, allowing them to communicate and exchange assets or data when needed. They typically consist of smart contracts and off-chain components that validate and relay information between connected chains.

## Available Bridge Solutions

Currently, the XRPL EVM Sidechain supports multiple bridge options for connecting to other networks when cross-chain functionality is desired:

### Axelar Network

One available option for cross-chain connectivity is the Axelar Network. Axelar is a decentralized cross-chain communication protocol that provides secure connectivity across Web3 ecosystems. It leverages a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model and is maintained by a network of validators that ensure message integrity during interchain transactions.

### Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)

As a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain, the XRPL EVM Sidechain natively supports Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), the standard protocol for secure communication between independent blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem. IBC enables trustless asset transfers and data exchange with other IBC-enabled chains, providing direct connectivity to the broader Cosmos network without requiring external bridge infrastructure.

### Wormhole Integration

Wormhole, one of the leading cross-chain interoperability protocols, is integrating with the XRPL EVM Sidechain. This integration will enable cross-chain messaging, asset transfers and multichain issuances of tokens which will support additional use cases across DeFi, institutional onchain finance, and real-world assets (RWAs).
