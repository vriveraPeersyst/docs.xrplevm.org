# Transfer to .xrpl Domain

Send XRP to human-readable .xrpl domain names instead of long wallet addresses! The XRPL EVM Transfer tool makes it easy to send XRP using names like **alice.xrpl** instead of complex addresses like `0x1234...abcd`.

## What are .xrpl Domains?

.xrpl domains are human-readable names that resolve to XRPL EVM wallet addresses, similar to how website domains work. Instead of asking someone for their full wallet address, you can simply ask for their .xrpl domain name.

**Benefits:**
- **Easy to remember:** `alice.xrpl` is much easier than `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb4`
- **Fewer errors:** No more copy-paste mistakes or typos
- **Professional:** Share a clean, branded domain name
- **Verifiable:** Anyone can look up who owns a domain

2. **Verify the Address**  
   The tool will automatically resolve the domain and show you the wallet address it belongs to. Double-check that it displays the correct address before proceeding.

   > **Tip:** You can also enter a regular `0x...` address if the recipient doesn't have a .xrpl domain yet.

### Step 3: Enter the Amount

1. **Specify XRP Amount**  
   Enter how much XRP you want to send in the **Amount** field

2. **Check Your Balance**  
   Make sure you have enough XRP to cover both the transfer amount and gas fees (usually a fraction of 1 XRP)

### Step 4: Send XRP

1. **Click "Send XRP"**  
   Review all the details one more time:
   - Recipient domain name and resolved address
   - Amount of XRP to send
   - Network (should be XRPL EVM Sidechain)

2. **Confirm in MetaMask**  
   - MetaMask will pop up asking you to confirm the transaction
   - Review the gas fee and total amount
   - Click **Confirm** to send the transaction

3. **Wait for Confirmation**  
   - The transaction usually completes in a few seconds
   - You'll see a success message with a transaction ID
   - Click the transaction ID to view details on the block explorer
