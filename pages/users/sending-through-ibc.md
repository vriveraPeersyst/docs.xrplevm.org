## Final Tips

- Transfers may take a few minutes to reflect on the destination chain.
- You can track the status using:
  - [XRPL EVM Explorers](../developers/resources/block-explorers.md)
  - The destination chain’s respective testnet explorer

> 🔁 Want to transfer back? Simply reverse the process, using the appropriate **reverse channel ID** in your destination chain’s Keplr wallet.
